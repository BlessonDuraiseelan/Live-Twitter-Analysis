# Twitter-Analysis
This is a Project done for the explanation of NLP Techniques applied in live feed of Tweets.
We are using Tweepy API that will be used to fetch tweets in realtime for the topic entered by the user.
The data is collected with various parameters such as tweet_user , location , time ,Retweets etc and converted to a dataframe.
Fetched tweets are cleaned by applying various NLP Techniques to obtain the desired insight.

The developed app gives the user various inputs for the user to apply and see the relative information live.
The app has been developed with the help of streamlit and has been hosted on the web by Heroku.
